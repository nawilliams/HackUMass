You might not consider this a hack, but I assure you, this was absolutely and most definitely hacked together.

## BE A DEV

Letâ€™s get down to **business**, to defeat this `code`

Did they send me ~~segfaults~~, when I asked for __nodes__?

You're the saddest team I ever met

But you can bet before we're through

Hacker, I'll make a `dev` out of you


#

Restful as a **server** but on fire within

Once you find your *center*, you are sure to win

You're a *tired*, *pale*, *pathetic* lot

And you haven't got a clue

Somehow I'll make a `dev` out of you

#

I'm never gonna get some sleep

Say goodbye to all my roommates

Boy, was I a fool in school for ~~cutting~~ class

That **judge** got us scared to death

Hope he doesn't see our repo

Now I really wish that I knew how to `git`

#

Be a `dev`

We must be swift as the *agile method*

Be a `dev`

With all the force of an **API**

Be a `dev`

With all the strength of a **servo motor**

Mysterious as the back-end of my `code`

#

Time is *racing* toward us till the last __deadline__

Heed my every order and you might survive

You're unsuited for this **hackathon**

So pack up, go home, you're through

How could I make a `dev` out of you?
